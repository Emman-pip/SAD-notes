# Idea 1:
- An automated centralized traffic control system using IoT and Deep Learning
  + this system will be able to recognize, analyze, control, and optimize the flow of traffic through a centralized artificial neural network system (ANN) and control the traffic lights in an area accordingly
  + ANN 
    - a programming paradigm that uses a biologically inspired artificial neural network to enable computers to learn from observations and data
  + Deep Learning
    - set of techniques used to teach ANNs

# why is this needed?
- the population is growing, so is the demand for road capacity. Here in the Philippines, it is known that traffic congestion is already bad. Traffic, as safe as it sounds, is a precursor to various negative repercussions. Road rage, slower travel, inconvinience, etc. 

# how should we combat it?
- first option: build more roads
- second: optimize traffic control
