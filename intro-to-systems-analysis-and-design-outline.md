# introduction to Systems Analysis and Design

## Information systems concept
    - are integrated elements that gets and uses data to support an organization's decision-making process and management
    - these systems are universal (can be desktop computers, laptops, or smartphones)

## Traditional applications
    - systems that streamline and optimize processes using traditional concepts.
    - Ex. 
          - Supermarket information systems
          - FedEx delivery systems
          - traffic control systems
          - cars information system (ignition control to air bags)

## Advanced applications
    - systems that uses variety of data to create stuff (conclusions, outputs, etc)
    - Ex.
        - online registration for schools during enrollments
        - e-learning systems (with lots of features)
        - social media

## What is technology?
  - outcome of science for applied purposes
  - can be an activity or forms and changes in culture
  - implementing sciences, maths, and arts to benefit life
  - science and engineering precedes technology

 Essential componenents of information systems
    a. hardware - physical component
    b. software - set of commands that instruct hardware what to do
        - operating systems and application software
    *** People and processes fall under the NETWORKING COMMUNICATION. Capability to communicate
    c. data - collection of indisputable raw facts
    d. people  - frontline user support staff to systems analysts to developers
    e. processes - series of steps taken to accomplish a goal

## brief history of information systems
- Peter drucker
    - 1959, said that information technology would become increasingly important
    - coined the term "knowledge worker"
        - people who make ang modify knowledge as a fundamental part of their jobs
    - predicted that the number of knowledge workers will increase in importance
        - referred to the phenomenon as KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY, ht NEW ECONOMY, DIGITAL SOCIETY , NETWORK ERA, and the INTERNET ERA
        - called as the DIGITAL WORLD today

## First era: mainframe and minicomputer
    - information systems were centralized and concered solely with governance and management
    - include third-gen mainframes (IBM 360)
    - used languages such as Assembler, Fortran, COBOL, Database

## Second era: personal computer
    - more people were benefitting from the technology
    - information systems were developed for more functionalities
    - included the first personal computers and mid-range computers

## Third era: Client/server
    - spread information, information became deconcentrated
    - the emergence of internet

## Fourth era: Enterprise
    - ISs are tied to governance and management but widely distributed to every employee
    - combined all aspects of business Enterprise

## Fifth era: cloud computing
    - access information systems from anywhere
    - information systems to accomplish task better, faster, and cheaper

# Categories of Information systems
## Transaction processing systems (TPS)
    - handle day-to-day business data 
    - for point-of-sale
    - data gathered will be used to learn about customers and their respective preferences (including trends)
    - example:
        - retail point of sale 
            + transaction capture
            + data processing
            + data storage
            + receipt generation
            + reporting
            + integration (with other systems)

## Management information systems (MIS)
    - used to organize the data from the TPS to support manegerial decisions
    - for inventory management and planning systems
    - example:
        - executive dashboard in a business intelligence system:
            - data integration
            - data Analysis
            - information presentation
            - decision support
            - report and forcasting
            - alerts and notifications

## Office automation systems (OAS)
    - used to support a wide range of predefined day-to-day activities of individuals and businesses
    - word, excel, presentation software, 

## knowledge management systems 
     - used to effectively capture organizational knowledge and enhance learning and optimize collaboratin efforts
     - some contents of these systems are training materials, compony policies, and procefures

## Decision support systems (DSS)
    - used to analyze data for the purpose of supporting decision decision-making
    - DSS' purpose include forecasting, resource optimizatin, analysis, etc.
    - designed interactive decision aid that applies MODELS to manipulate data

## Mobile applications
